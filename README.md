# Valerie Forrester

Always keen to expand my toolkit, I am currently enjoying the challenge of getting to grips with data exploration using Python through a Data Science bootcamp with HyperionDev. As I continue on my Python journey, I will be sharing some of my projects here.

My varied professional background has led me to finding what really makes me tick: trying to solve the puzzle of how we most meaningfully see and connect with the social world around us.

I've settled into being an experienced social researcher, knowledgeable in both qualitative and quantitative methods and enthusiastic to bring my knowledge to help others reach a better understanding of the things that matter to them.
